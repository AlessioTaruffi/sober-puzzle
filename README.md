# Sober Puzzle

This represents the final project for the Human Computer Interaction on the Web course. It's a mobile app developed using React Native that presents the user with a series of highly interactive minigames one after the other in order to test his mental and phisical skills in an optic of risk assessment after a stressful event (night out drinking, prolonged lack of sleep...). Every minigame leverages different phone sensors and features testing one or more skills such as concentration, memory, equilibrium and reaction time.
